# The Manual Weight Loss Planner

## Introduction
The Manual Weight Loss planner is a mobile application which allows users to input their details and get an estimated calorie amount for the day (based on scientific formulas) depending on their weekly weight loss goals. 

After that they can calculate their calories for the day manually by selecting each day of the week and putting in their meal details, such as calories, protein, fat, etc. This requires the user does it all manually which can be more time consuming than other mobile weight loss apps, however this does give more customization back to the user, and should be for people who are focused on their goal. 

It also has a graphing section where you can put input your weight for the day, and it will give a basic graph, storing all your previous information to be used as a trajectory.
